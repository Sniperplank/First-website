            <p class="toggleText" id="highSchoolInfo">I went to T.L. Kennedy high school and it was in grade 11 when I was introduced to
                programming. Before that point I had no idea what coding was, or how it worked. Even
                though I was super interested in computers. I took computer science again in grade 12,
                and even though my marks were barely getting me to pass the course, because of my lack
                of understanding of coding, I loved programming.

                interested in my new found hobby that was introduced to me in high school. I was watching
                a lot of tutorials on how to code and did some small projects. And I learned a lot during
                that time.

            <p class="toggleText" id="creatingGamesInfo">During my time off school, I played a lot of video games. One day, I thought, if I like
                playing games so much, and I love coding and making stuff. Why don't I try to make my own
                game. And with that, I started looking into tutorials on how to create my own game. I
                picked up Unity Game engine and I created a lot of small "games" that had basic movement
                and very small levels. However, my last game was a game that I was satisfied with. And
                I will share more about it in the <b>Hobbies</b> page.
